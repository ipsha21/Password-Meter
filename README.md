# Project

## Password-Meter
Measures the entropy of a password
Language: Python

### Introduction
The project mainly focuses on measuring the entropy, or the strength, of a password. The aim is to create a tool which can analyze a given password and compute its strength in terms of how easily it could be cracked. The larger goal of the application is to help increase security, and put people on control of the privacy of their own personal information.

 
This project is being developed in participation with the 2nd edition of [Learn IT, Girl!](https://www.learnitgirl.com/) - a mentorship program for women around the globe!
